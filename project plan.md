Research Question: Can a dependently typed language be made in spoofax?
Preliminary Answer: Yes.

Projects:
[x] Research how dependent type checking works (4 weeks)
[x] Implement CoC in sdf3+statix (2 weeks)
[x] Using krivine-inspired architecture to improve performance (1 week)
    - Needed to change a rule?

[~] Fixing name collisions (See "Tricky Types" tests, 2 weeks???)
    - Statix does not support string concat :c
    - Very complex

[ ] Inductive data types with positivity + coverage checking (1-4 weeks?)
[ ] Adding synctactic sugar (1 week)
[ ] Language-parametric services exploration (few weeks?)
[ ] Implicit arguments (not sure?)
[ ] Fixpoints and termination checking (1-4 weeks?)
[ ] Universe support (1-4 weeks?)
