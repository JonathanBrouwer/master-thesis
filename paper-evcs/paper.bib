	abstract = {We present a particularly simple lazy lambda-calculus machine, which was introduced twenty-five years ago. It has been, since, used and implemented by several authors, but remained unpublished. We also build an extension, with a control instruction and continuations. This machine was conceived in order to execute programs obtained from mathematical proofs, by means of the Curry-Howard (also known as "proof-program") correspondence. The control instruction corresponds to the axiom of excluded middle.},
