Abstract
Introduction: 
- Simply typed lambda + system f (Scopes as types)

- We thought it would be hard because:
- Hindley Milner not possible? (No paper)
- Generalization requires knowing which variables are free

- Show typing rules that we implement (note challenges in dependent types)
- Use math notation
- What do 
- Show possible extensions, mention results
- Related work?
    - Pi for all / other toy implementations]
    
- Conclusion
