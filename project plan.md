Research Question: Can a dependently typed language be made in spoofax?
Preliminary Answer: Yes.

Projects:
[x] Research how dependent type checking works (4 weeks)
[x] Implement CoC in sdf3+statix (2 weeks)
[x] Using krivine-inspired architecture to improve performance (1 week)
    - Needed to change a rule?
[x] Fixing name collisions (See "Tricky Types" test 1, few days)
    - Statix does not support string concat :c

[ ] Adding synctactic sugar (1 week)
[ ] Language-parametric services exploration (1 week?)
[ ] Implicit arguments (not sure?)
[ ] Fixpoints and termination checking (1-4 weeks?)
