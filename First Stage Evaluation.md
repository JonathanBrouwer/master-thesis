== Research Question
How well Statix is fit for the task of defining a simple dependently-typed language
- Is Statix expressive enough? (What can we add to Statix to improve it?)
- What do we get for free? Editor services?
- Can extra features (data types/universes/etc) be described concisely in Statix?
- How does statix compare with other implementations?


== Plan
Q1:
- Implement Lody in Spoofax (Done!)
- Make EVCS paper (Done)
Q2:
- Implement interesting parts of Lody in Haskell
- Implement interesting parts of Lody in Lambdapi
(which parts?)
- Universe polymorphism?
- Syntactic sugar for match?
- Start writing thesis, have first draft finished at end of Q2 or start Q3
Q3:
- Finish writing thesis
- Presentation
