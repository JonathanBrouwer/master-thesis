\chapter{Related Work}
The implementation in this paper requires performing substitutions in types immediately, as types don't have a scope. Van Antwerpen et al. \cite[sect 2.5]{scopes_as_types} present an implementation of System F that does lazy substitutions, by using scopes as types. It would be interesting to see if this approach could also apply to the Calculus of Constructions, where types can contain terms. 

Another interesting comparison is to see how implementing a dependently typed language in Statix differs from implementing it in a general purpose language. The pi-forall language\cite{pi_forall} is a good example of a language with a similar complexity to the language presented in this paper. In principle, the implementations are very similar. For example, the inference rules presented in \cite{pi_forall} are similar to the inference rules presented in figure \ref{fig:type-check-rules} from this paper. The primary difference is that they use a bidirectional type system, whereas this paper does not.

There exist several so-called \emph{logical frameworks}, tools designed specifically for implementing and experimenting with dependent type theories, such as ALF~\cite{MagnussonN93}, Twelf~\cite{PfenningS99}, Dedukti~\cite{BoespflugCH12}, Elf~\cite{pfenning_1991} and Andromeda~\cite{BauerHP20}. Since these tools are designed specifically for the task, implementing the type system takes less effort in them compared to Spoofax, but for other tasks such as defining a parser or editor services they are not as well equipped. Some logical frameworks such as Twelf and Dedukti support Miller's \emph{higher-order pattern unification}~\cite{Miller89}, which can be used as a more powerful way of inferring implicit arguments than the first-order unification built into Statix. Andromeda 2 also supports \emph{extensionality rules} that can match on the type of an equality. We expect that adding extensionality rules to our implementation would be possible to do in Statix, but we leave an actual implementation to future work.
